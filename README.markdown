*WTF? (Why the fork?)* I liked this app so much that I wanted to see if it could be done in node.js. So I did it.

What do you need to run it:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 
* [Haml-js](http://github.com/creationix/haml-js), or just install it with `npm install haml`
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), also, can be installed with `npm install express`

Optional sexy stuff:
* [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) it compiles to js anyway

Now, the original stuff:

Commitment is a small Tornado application that generates random commit messages.
